## Important considerations within your Conversational AI (Voice) Strategy
============

# Before you design a Virtual Assistant platform

- consider 80 % of your Development Work done by your not IT Department therefore Low Code capabilities are critical to scale your further platform
- compare and evaluate the cost/use (Kosten-Nutzen) ratio between use cases build on low code and pro-code bases on cost per transaction
- evaluate the drag and drop experiences of low-code by your users - Question - is it as easy as using PowerPoint and to endure your end users are willing to use it without magjor training cost
- Ensure that your Bot Platforms enable end users besides your Pro-Developers are able to do simple math operation like excel or docs sheets

# Strategic themes were you need a plan

- have a strategy to Empower business users and developers on the same platform
- implement a system to building and keeping a bot up-to-date bot fast. There should be no need for IT or dev teams to deploy code each time a Assistant  is updated.
- Implement a catalog of criteria when you want to to deal with hosting or complex, costly infrastructure. Ensure you can leverage the power of SaaS with his low complexity of infrastructure cost to ensure the possibility of long term scalability - up and down
- you Application need to be available everywhere, therefore you need to consider a Zero trust strategy from day one. Do not stop at the boarders of your Firewall because the Internet is the new WAN (engage with customers/employees on website, mobile app, Facebook, Teams or more, even on there private devices)
- Engage with customers and employees conversationally. Learn how to train your AI inhouse - do not outsource this to 100%. Your Pro Developers need to focus on that process, where you actually build your AI not the Assistant. Which tool do they feel comfortable to support the Business users an most important ensure that you keep the ownership of this trained algorithms because never forget:
  

        #Data is the new gold !


- Start with something simple but not trivial. the complexity is hiding in your process not in the technology. the Weather is trivial, replace a form or a scanned pdf from a sign off process is also simple but not trivial. That´s where the power and expectance comes from. Ask you users though design thinking. You will be surprised what makes sense or not - its always something you never though off
- Do not think you are done after the project. Continuously Improve is the key metrics. Insights help  you what topics to build next. Make long term decision on a platform as you will never be done once you start the AI path.

  - know what connectors you need at day 1 and count connectors you platform is providing you out of the books - Its simple: More is better, even if you do not need them today, who knows what you need next month. This ensures that you can keep pace and ensure futher action
  - If 80 % is low code 20 % is still High Code - ensure that you platform integrates into known Frameworks with SDK´s, Adaptive Dialogs, Cognitive Services etc.



























































Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
keyword   text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
